 * Owner-facing game management, mounted at `/g/*` (see `GAMES_PREFIX` in
 * `src/auth/paths.ts`).
 *
 * **Registration order matters.** `NEW_GAME_PATH` (`/g/new`) is registered
 * here, on its own, with nothing else under `/g/*` yet. The next task in this
 * milestone adds a `/g/:id` route (and friends) for reading/editing a
 * specific game — that route MUST be registered *after* `NEW_GAME_PATH`.
 * Hono matches routes in registration order, and `:id` matches the literal
 * string `"new"` just as readily as a real id, so a `/g/:id` registered
 * first would swallow `GET /g/new` and treat "new" as a game id — a 404 (or
 * worse, some other game's page) where a form should be.
